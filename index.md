## Current Projects
- **Deep learning for ubiquitination site prediction**
Developing deep neural networks that integrate protein sequence and structural features to predict novel ubiquitination (Ub) sites, with a focus on post-translational regulation.
- **Cancer genomics analysis of ubiquitination-linked mutations**
Analyzing TCGA cancer datasets to investigate how mutations at or near predicted ubiquitination sites impact patient survival, protein function, and pathway dysregulation.

## Previous Projects

- **Machine learning classification of bacterial OTU deubiquitinases**
Using supervised ML models to classify novel bacterial OTU deubiquitinases from primary amino acid sequences, contributing to functional annotation of microbial proteins.
- **IgAseq: an R package for IgA-seq data analysis**
Building and documenting an R package to streamline analysis of IgA-seq datasets, enabling reproducible workflows for immunoglobulin profiling.

## About me!

Hi, I’m Justine Nguyen, a PhD candidate in Bioinformatics & Computational Biomedicine at Oregon Health & Science University. My research integrates machine learning, protein structure analysis, and large-scale biological data to solve complex problems in molecular biology and computational health science.

My journey into science began with a degree in Human Physiology from the University of Oregon, where I worked in a developmental biology lab studying how protein signaling pathways drive heart development in embryonic mice. This hands-on experience in molecular biology sparked my interest in the molecular mechanisms behind health and disease.

After graduating, I joined a neuroscience lab at OHSU focused on RNA-editing techniques for correcting mutations in Rett Syndrome mouse models. There, I gained exposure to high-throughput sequencing technologies including RNA-seq, DNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq, and I quickly became fascinated by the analytical side of genomics.

That led me to pursue a Master’s in Bioinformatics, where I developed machine learning models to classify ubiquitin-related protein families based solely on amino acid sequences. Now, as a PhD student, I’m continuing this work by building deep learning models to predict post-translational modifications and analyzing TCGA cancer datasets to uncover how mutations impact protein function and biological pathways.

Beyond research, I’m passionate about data science, scientific software development, and helping bridge the gap between wet-lab biology and computational insights. I’m experienced in Python, R, SQL, and Linux, and I love building tools that are reproducible, interpretable, and impactful.
