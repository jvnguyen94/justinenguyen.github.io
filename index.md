## Current Projects

- **Deep learning for ubiquitination site prediction**  
  Developing deep neural networks that integrate protein sequence and structural features to predict novel ubiquitination (Ub) sites, with a focus on post-translational regulation.

- **Cancer genomics analysis of ubiquitination-linked mutations**  
  Analyzing TCGA cancer datasets to investigate how mutations at or near predicted ubiquitination sites impact patient survival, protein function, and pathway dysregulation.

## About Me

Hi, I’m **Justine Nguyen**, a PhD candidate in **Bioinformatics & Computational Biomedicine** at **Oregon Health & Science University**. I apply data-driven approaches to understand biological systems and solve challenges at the intersection of life sciences and technology.

My work centers around using **machine learning**, **protein structure modeling**, and **data analytics** to extract insights from complex biomedical data. I enjoy transforming raw, unstructured information into actionable knowledge that supports decision-making and innovation.

With a background in human biology and strong technical expertise, I’ve built predictive models, automated analysis pipelines, and created data visualizations to support research, development, and operational needs.

I’m proficient in **Python**, **R**, **SQL**, and **Linux**, and experienced with tools such as **pandas**, **scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, **matplotlib**, and **R Shiny**. I focus on building solutions that are **reproducible**, **interpretable**, and **impact-driven**.

I’m excited to bring my experience in computational biology and data science to roles that require critical thinking, technical depth, and a passion for solving real-world problems.
