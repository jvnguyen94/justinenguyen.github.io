- packaging IgA-seq package via R  

## About me!

My name is Justine Nguyen. I am currently a PhD candidate at Oregon Health & Science University, studying bioinformatics!

I have always had a fascination with science and the rigor of the scientific method. I previously studied Human Physiology in undergrad at the University of Oregon. During this time period, I was working in a developmental biology lab, studying how protein signaling directed heart myocardium development in embryonic mice. I was able to explore the world of molecular biology and this drove me to explore other options that scientific research had to offer!

Afterwards, I worked in a lab at OHSU that was using RNA-editing techniques to fix point mutations in Rett Syndrome mouse models. During this period, I was introduced to a slew of sequencing technologies - ranging from RNA seq, DNA seq, ATAC seq, and ChIP-seq. This drove me to pursue a master's in bioinformatics at OHSU. I wanted to understand how to analyze sequencing data and the algorithms behind these methods.

During my master's I worked on a machine learning project, using amino acid sequences to classify families of proteins related to the ubiquitin system. After completing my master's I was passionate about learning more about data science, machine learning, and utilizing all these tools to solve biological computational problems, which is why I am continuing with a PhD in bioinformatics.
