#### 1) Description of Type of Graph

This is a bar chart or bar graph, which is good for comparing numerical data over time or amongst various groups.

<br>

#### 2) Description of Data

The data in the visualization is from Nathan Yau's hot dog contest. This was curated by Jackie Wirz and Steven Bedrick, both of whom ported the data into R and did some minor clean up before it was loaded to be visualized. This data depicts male data for the hot dog eating contest. It has information of hot dogs eaten per year, who won, and the person's organizational affiliation.

<br>

#### 3) Audience and Purpose

The purpose of this visualization is to show how hot dog eating contests have become popular over the years. On top of that, we wanted to see winners of hot dog eating contests were MLE/IFOCE member. The audience of this visualization is for anyone who is interested in how hot dog eating contests have been popularized over the year and how hot dog associations tracked with hot dog eating competitions' rising popularity.

#### 4) Representation Description

Bar charts typically depict categorical data on one axis and numerical data (counts/proportions) on the other axes. Each of the bars are proportional to each other in measurement to show changes in values amongst different groups in the categorical data. If the bars are going up and down, then the categorical variable is on the x-axis and the y-axis is the numerical data, since the heights of the bars show differences in the values.

Bar charts can become more complex if there are additional subgroups in the categorical data. Differing colors clustered under the same x-axis group can break the main category group down into subgroups.

#### 5) What to Read and What to Look For

When first reading a bar chart, it is important to take note which direction the bars are facing (are the bars horizontal? or vertical?) When the bars are vertical, the categorical data is on the x-axis. If the bars are horizontal then the categorical data lies on the y-axis. It is a good idea to get oriented with the categorical data to see if it is different groups or if it is different timepoints that are being depicted. 

After getting oriented with what is being compared, it is a good idea to look at the opposing axis to see what the measurement value is. At this point, you can use the heights of the bars to see which category has the highest or lowest measurement and compare values across all the groups.

However, reading bar charts can become complex if categories are faceted into two variables. Color can be used to break down subgroups futher to add another comparison within the set groups.

From this visualization we see that the x-axis contains the year from 1981 to 2017. The y-axis shows number of hot dogs consumed from winners from contests at each year. What we can see from this plot is that there is an increase in hot dogs consumed at winning contests, and the number increases as the year increases. Further more, once the MLE/IFOCE were created, there were sharp increases in the number of hot dogs consumed at these contests.

#### 6) Presentation Tips

**Annotation:** Annotation can be used to highlight a group of interest in the bargraph. In the example depicted from the NHEC data, we highlighted groups of people who won the hot dog competition for that year. You can see that there is a pattern of who won based on their affiliation. Alternatively, annotation could be used to highlight outliers or a group of interest if it does not pop out with an inital glance on the graph. Some people also use annotation to add statistical significance if p-values are generated by comparing differences in groups.

**Color:** Color can be used to break down categorical variables into subgroups. This can allow you to study two categorical variables concurrently against the measurement value. For example, if you were looking at GDP changes across different countries, GDP would be the numerical while countries would be categorical. But you can break down countries into continents subgroup by using different colors to color each continent. With this type of analysis, the subgroups could be laid out side by side, or even stacked on top of each other. It depends what your purpose is... Side by side subgroup break downs would be good for comparing all countries to each other. Stacked would be good for showing the differences in continents, but if you also wanted to show the highest GDP country.

**Composition:** The composition of the graph can help make the point of your figure. If the differences amongst the groups are nuanced, you may not want to use an absolute scale for the numerical axis. However, if you do this, you need to be conscientious in making it clear that the axis is altered. Another way to play with compsition for bar charts when bars are faceted by two variables is to add spaces amongst the groups so that it is more clear that there is a distinction in groups based on position AND color.

#### 7) Variations and Alternatives

A variation of bar chart is pie charts. Pie charts show part of a whole and are based on proportions. However, our eyes play tricks on us when we are comparing areas rather than heights. It can also be really hard to show your data if you have too many categories in a pie chart.

Line charts are also an alterative to bar charts, but this only works if there is a relationship when moving from one category to the next. This would make sense if you had time dependent data and there is a relationship that could be extrapolated in a manner that makes sense from one category to the next.

#### 8) How to Create the Graph 

````
## Read in data
sounds <- read.csv(here::here("data", "animal_sounds_summary.csv"))


fct_reorder2(as.factor(sounds$sound), ## sound becomes factor
             sounds$age, ## x var
             sounds$prop_produce) %>% ## y var
  levels ## Grab the distinct levels produced
  

ggplot(sounds, aes(x = age, 
                   y = prop_produce, 
                   fill = fct_reorder2(sound, age, prop_produce))) +
  geom_smooth(aes(color = fct_reorder2(sound, age, prop_produce)),
              se = FALSE, lwd = .5, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_point(size = 2, shape = 21, color = "midnightblue") +
  labs(x = "Age (months)", 
       y = "Proportion of Children Producing", 
       fill = "sound") +
  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +
  scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +
  theme_bw()

#### 9) Initial Plot and Improvements

![](/images/animal_sounds_init.png)

Above was the initial plot generated from the data. The bar chart shows the number of hot dogs consumed at winning contests every year, but there is a lot of annotation missing about MLE/IFOCE association. By adding color based on association and labeling it in the final visualization, it is easier to see association. The labels were also changed to be more informative and the title, too, to show what the research question is. I also simplified the graphics to make it look cleaner.
