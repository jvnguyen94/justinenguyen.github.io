#### 1) Description of Type of Graph

This is a scatterplot, which is good for looking at all individual data points and comparing two numerical values.

<br>

#### 2) Description of Data

The data in the visualization is from the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). This is publically available data on GitHub and is analyzed by fivethirtyeight.com.

<br>

#### 3) Audience and Purpose

The purpose of this plot is to examine whether there was a correlation of artist age with the number of paintings that they produced that got into the MoMA. The audience is for people interested in the statistics of MoMA artists! Probably art enthusiests or history buffs!

#### 4) Representation Description

Scatterplots are good for looking at relationships between two numerical variables. This plots each individual data point so that we can examine whether there is a relationship between the two variables. This allows us to examine the raw data to see if there is a distinct pattern within the data across the two variables of interest.

<br>

#### 5) What to Read and What to Look For

When first reading a scatterplot, it is important to note the two variables being compared in the x-axis and y-axis. It is also important to keep in mind what the scale is for each of the variables. After orienting to the variables being compared, we can examine the scatter points and see if there is a relationship or shape that the data points trend. We can also look to see whether there are data points that are outliers to the general pattern displayed between the variables.

As you can see in the MoMA data, there is not really a linear trend between the Number of Paintings versus the Artist Age. However, you can see that there was one artist who created more paintings that made it into the MoMA compared to their age. There may be two groups of artists - those who produced a lot of art that got into the MoMA and those who only have a few (clustered more closely towards the a-axis!)

#### 6) Presentation Tips

**Annotation:** Annotation can be used as a comparison to see if the data follows a trend. In this point, there is a line plotted that shows the trend if an author made the same number of paintings as their age. This can be used as a baseline to see if artists created paintings that made it into the MoMA that were the same as half their number of years lived. I arbitrarily picked that as a threshold to use as a comparison. There are a few points that are not quite at the threshold I picked but trending similarly.

**Color:** Color can be used to break down categorical variables into subgroups. However, we were only comparing a singular group: the artists that made it into the MoMA; that is why this plot only has one color. It makes sense to keep the colors simplistic in this case because there are not other distinguishing factors we are trying to show.

**Composition:** The composition of the graph can help make the point of your figure. The scale of how much you zoom in for each of the variables will dictate how clustered or unclustered the data is. This is especially important when we have outliers in our data. If the scale zooms in too much, we may be excluding outliers in the plot and that changes the ultimate conclusion of our data.

#### 7) Variations and Alternatives

A variation of this plot would be a line plot, because with line plots, we can also show the relationship between two numerical values. However, line plots are more appropriate when there is a relationship for the data points across the x-axis variable. It might not be appropriate in this case to look at a line graph with these variables.

#### 8) How to Create the Graph 

````
## Read in the data
moma <- read.csv(here("./data/artworks-cleaned.csv"))

## Calculate age of artists
moma_age <- moma %>% select(artist,artist_death_year, artist_birth_year) %>%
  mutate(artist_age = artist_death_year - artist_birth_year)

## Count paintings for artists
moma_count <- moma_age %>% count(artist)

## Merge data frames. Drop artist duplicates
moma_count_merge <- merge(moma_count, moma_age, by = "artist")
moma_count_merge <- moma_count_merge %>% distinct(artist, .keep_all = TRUE)

ggplot(moma_count_merge, aes(artist_age, n)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(slope = 0.5, color="gray") +
  ylim(05,60) +
  xlim(05, 100) +
  theme_few() +
  ylab("Number of paintings") +
  xlab("Artist Age") +
  ggtitle("Examining artist age and how many paintings created in lifetime") +
  annotate(x = 75, y = 40, 
           geom = "text",
           label = "Line signifies if artist made half \nnumber of paintings as age ->", color = "darkgray",
           size = 3,
           hjust = 1, 
           fontface = 2,
           family = "Lato")

#### 9) Initial Plot and Improvements 

![](/images/moma_init.png)

Above in the preliminary plot, I plotted only the number of paintings vs artist age. There is no annotation of the line as a point of reference. There is also no title to give reference as to what is being compared. Also, the gray grids in the background are distracting from the data itself. Just cleaning up the composition of the graph makes it more readable.
