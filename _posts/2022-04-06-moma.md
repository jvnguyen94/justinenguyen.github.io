#### 1) Description of Type of Graph

This is a scatterplot, which is good for looking at all individual data points and comparing two numerical values.

<br>

#### 2) Description of Data

The data in the visualization is from the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). This is publically available data on GitHub and is analyzed by fivethirtyeight.com.

<br>

#### 3) Representation Description

Scatterplots are good for looking at relationships between two numerical variables. This plots each individual data point so that we can examine whether there is a relationship between the two variables.

<br>

#### 4) What to Read and What to Look For

When first reading a scatterplot, it is important to note the two variables being compared in the x-axis and y-axis. It is also important to keep in mind what the scale is for each of the variables. After orienting to the variables being compared, we can examine the scatter points and see if there is a relationship or shape that the data points trend. We can also look to see whether there are data points that are outliers to the general pattern displayed between the variables.

As you can see in the MoMA data, there is not really a linear trend between the Number of Paintings versus the Artist Age. However, you can see that there was one artist who created more paintings that made it into the MoMA compared to their age.

#### 5) Presentation Tips

**Annotation:** Annotation can be used as a comparison to see if the data follows a trend. In this point, there is a line plotted that shows the trend if an author made the same number of paintings as their age. This can be used as a baseline to see if artists created paintings that made it into the MoMA that were the same as their number of years lived.

**Color:** Color can be used to break down categorical variables into subgroups. However, we were only comparing a singular group: the artists that made it into the MoMA; that is why this plot only has one color.

**Composition:** The composition of the graph can help make the point of your figure. The scale of how much you zoom in for each of the variables will dictate how clustered or unclustered the data is. This is especially important when we have outliers in our data. If the scale zooms in too much, we may be excluding outliers in the plot and that changes the ultimate conclusion of our data.

#### 6) Variations and Alternatives

A variation of this plot would be a line plot, because with line plots, we can also show the relationship between two numerical values. However, line plots are more appropriate when there is a relationship for the data points across the x-axis variable.

#### 7) How to Create the Graph 

```{r, eval=F}
## Read in the data
moma <- read.csv(here("./data/artworks-cleaned.csv"))

## Calculate age of artists
moma_age <- moma %>% select(artist,artist_death_year, artist_birth_year) %>%
  mutate(artist_age = artist_death_year - artist_birth_year)

## Count paintings for artists
moma_count <- moma_age %>% count(artist)

## Not sophisticated... but merge data frames. Drop artist duplicates
moma_count_merge <- merge(moma_count, moma_age, by = "artist")
moma_count_merge <- moma_count_merge %>% distinct(artist, .keep_all = TRUE)

ggplot(moma_count_merge, aes(artist_age, n)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(slope = 0.5, color="gray") +
  ylim(05,60) +
  xlim(05, 100) +
  theme_few() +
  ylab("Number of paintings") +
  xlab("Artist Age") +
  ggtitle("Examining artist age and how many paintings created in lifetime") +
  annotate(x = 75, y = 40, 
           geom = "text",
           label = "Line signifies if artist made half \nnumber of paintings as age ->", color = "darkgray",
           size = 3,
           hjust = 1, 
           fontface = 2,
           family = "Lato")
```
